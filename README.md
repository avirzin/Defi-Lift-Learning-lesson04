# Defi Lift Learning Lesson 04 Exercises

Some exercises for Defi Lifr Learning course.

Just some Hardhat commands that I used the most.

To compile:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
```
To deploy:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon
```

To verify:

```shell
npx hardhat verify [ADRESS] --network polygon --contract [FILE_AND_NAME] [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT_SAME_AT_THE_DEPLOY]
```
